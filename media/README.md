Functional Requirements:
1. User Authentication:
   - Users should be able to register, log in, and log out.
   - Only authenticated users can upload media, create posts, and comment.

2. Media Upload:
   - Users can upload videos and pictures.
   - Supported media formats include common video and image formats.
   - Uploaded media should be associated with the user who uploaded it.

3. Post Creation:
   - Authenticated users can create posts.
   - Posts can include a title, description, and uploaded media (videos or pictures).
   - Posts should display the username of the author and the timestamp.

4. Comment System:
   - Users can add comments to posts.
   - Comments should display the username of the commenter and the timestamp.
   - Comments can include text.

5. Home Page:
   - The home page should provide an overview of the platform.
   - Include a brief description of the media platform's features and purpose.
   - Display a feed of recent posts, including media and associated comments.

6. User Profile:
   - Each user should have a profile page displaying their uploaded media, posts, and comments.
   - Include a user's profile picture and a brief bio.

Non-functional Requirements:
1. Security:
   - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

2. Scalability:
   - Design the platform to handle a growing number of users, media, and posts.
   - Optimize database queries for efficient retrieval of media and posts.

3. User Experience:
   - Design an intuitive and responsive user interface.
   - Ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for users interacting with the platform.

4. Accessibility:
   - Ensure the platform is accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Implement responsive design for different devices and screen sizes.

5. Testing:
   - Develop and execute unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests.
   - Ensure the platform is stable and free of critical bugs.

Technological Stack:
1. Django Framework:
   - Use Django to handle backend logic, database management, and URL routing.
   - Utilize Django's built-in authentication system for user management.

2. Database:
   - Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user data, posts, comments, and media metadata.

3. Frontend:
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
   - Optionally, consider using a frontend framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.

4. Cloud Storage (Optional):
   - Consider using cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3) for storing uploaded media.

5. Version Control:
   - Use Git for version control, and host the code on a platform like GitHub.

Remember to adapt these requirements based on your specific needs and the scale of your project. Additionally, consider breaking down these requirements into user stories and tasks for easier implementation and project management.

1. **`authentication` App:**
   - **Responsibility:** Handles user authentication, registration, and user profile functionalities.
   - **Components:**
     - `models.py`: Define user-related models (e.g., UserProfile).
     - `views.py`: Implement views for user authentication (login, registration, logout) and profile management.
     - `forms.py`: Define forms for user authentication and registration.
     - `urls.py`: Define URL patterns for authentication-related views.
     - `templates/authentication/`: Store HTML templates for authentication views.

2. **`core` App:**
   - **Responsibility:** Manages core features of your platform, such as creating and displaying posts.
   - **Components:**
     - `models.py`: Define models for posts, comments, and other core functionalities.
     - `views.py`: Implement views for creating posts, viewing post details, and handling comments.
     - `forms.py`: Define forms for creating posts and adding comments.
     - `urls.py`: Define URL patterns for core features.
     - `templates/core/`: Store HTML templates for core views.

Organizing your project into these apps allows for better separation of concerns and makes it easier to maintain and extend the functionality of each feature. For example, if you decide to add more features related to user authentication in the future, you can focus on the `authentication` app without impacting the other parts of your project.

Here's a high-level overview of how these apps could be used together:

- **User Registration and Authentication Flow:**
  - `authentication` app handles user registration, login, and logout.
  - User profile information is stored in the `UserProfile` model.

- **Media Upload and Management:**
  - `media` app manages the uploading and storage of videos and pictures.
  - Uploaded media files are stored in the `uploads/` directory.

- **Creating and Displaying Posts:**
  - `core` app is responsible for creating posts with titles, descriptions, and associated media.
  - Posts are displayed on the home page, and users can view post details.

- **Commenting on Posts:**
  - `core` app also handles the commenting functionality on posts.
